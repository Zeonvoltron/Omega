# Omega: What is it?
Omega is a digital organism, it reproduces from drive to drive freely and has the ability to mutate and evolve over time. Its not just a simulation of life or evolution, if realesed to the world it will replicate autonomously and it will adapt to the changing environment. Omega is not a malicious program, but it cud evolve to become one.
# Creators:
Omega was created by Lorenzo Vittone with colaboration of his broder Gregorio Vittone
# How to install it?
To install it you will have to download the folder named Omega and muve it to C:\. Once there, you just need to double-click de Omega.exe file that is inside the Omega folder.
Warning: once installed, Omega will replace all the folders in your desktop by shortcuts that will give you acces to the original folders. I donÂ´t take any responsability of any damage that Omega (or a mutated version of Omega) might couse to your computer. Act on your own risk!!!
